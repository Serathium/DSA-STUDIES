# 1-1 Comparison of running times

For each function f(n) and time t in the following table, determine the largest size n of a problem that can be solved in time t , assuming that the algorithm to solve the problem takes f(n) microseconds.  

![table 1](1-1table.png)

*f(n)* = time_in_microseconds  
log<sub>2</sub>n = 10<sup>6</sup> "this is one second in microseconds"   
n = 2<sup>10<sup>6</sup></sup>  

A problem with input size n = 2<sup>10<sup>6</sup></sup> (where 10<sup>6</sup> is the amount of microseconds in a second) would take one second to be solved with an algorithm that has time efficiency log<sub>2</sub>n.  
This is the solution for the first row, first column. I'm not going to do this for every cell, but the logic stays the same for all.
