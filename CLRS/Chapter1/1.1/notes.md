# The Roles of Algorithms in Computing

## Algorithms

Informally, an algorithm is a computational procedure that takes a value or set of values as input and produces a value or set of values as output.

## Data Structures

A data structure is a way to store and organize data to facilitate access and modifications.

## P vs NP vs NP-Hard vs NP-Complete Problems

A P problem (polynomial time problem) is a computational problem which can be solved in polynomial time, while an NP problem (nondeterministic polynomial time problem) can have it's solution verified in polynomial time. Though it's believed NP problems need exponential time to be solved, it's not proven.  

An NP-Hard problem (nondeterministic polynomial time hard problem) is a problem which may or may not have a verifiable solution in polynomial time, therefore an NP-Hard problem might not be in NP. Additionally, **_EVERY_** problem in NP can be reduced to an NP-Hard problem in polynomial time, meaning that if you solve an NP-Hard problem, you solved every problem in NP.  

Lastly, an NP-Complete problem (nondeterministic polynomial time complete problem) is both NP-Hard and NP at the same time.
