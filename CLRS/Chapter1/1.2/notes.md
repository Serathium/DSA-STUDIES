# Algorithms as Technology  

Even if computers were infinitely fast, studying algorithms would still serve a purpose: 
to know if the algorithm you're implementing behaves correctly.  
However, that's not reality. Computing power and memory are still limited and, although 
inexpensive, are not free. Therefore, efficient algorithms are of utmost importance.  

## Efficiency  

Different algorithms have different efficiency depending on the input size.  
For an algorithm such as ***insertion sort***, it usually has better perfomance 
with smaller input sizes, as opposed to ***merge sort*** with a large enough input size, which will have better 
performance than insertion sort.

## Algorithms and other technologies  

Algorithms should be considered as technology. The reason for that is that they exert just 
as much influence on performance as hardware does. And hardware, in turn, also takes advantages 
of algorithms for optimization in it's conception.
